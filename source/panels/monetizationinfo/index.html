      TETR.IO isn't free to run, and blocking ads means osk doesn't recieve any
      revenue. The game includes an option to turn off ads natively, but still
      loads the ad script. Using TETR.IO PLUS's ad blocker will block this
      script, preventing it from tracking you.

      If you block ads, take a moment to consider purchasing TETR.IO Supporter
      through the in-game menu. If you're already a supporter, great! You should
      use this anyway because invasive ad scripts.
      
      Consider also reading osk's
      <a id='blogpost' href="#">blog post</a>
      about the addition of ads into the game.
